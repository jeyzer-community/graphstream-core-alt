  <comment>The GraphStream library. With GraphStream you deal with
		graphs. Static and Dynamic. You create them from scratch, from a file
		or any source. You display and render them. This is the core package
		that contains the minimal needed to read, display and write a graph. NO_M2ECLIPSE_SUPPORT: Project files created with the maven-eclipse-plugin are not supported in M2Eclipse.</comment>
